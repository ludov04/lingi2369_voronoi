 * Red-Black Tree http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree
 *
 * Insert - O(log n)
 * Lookup - O(log n)
 * Remove - O(log n)
 *
 * -Notes-
 *
 * This is an implementation of Okasaki's red-black tree introduced in his fantastic book
 * "Purely Functional Data Structures and Algorithms". Here is the short link to article:
 *
 *            www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs3500wc/jfp99redblack.pdf
 *
 * As well, as Okasaki's tree this implementation doesn't contain a 'remove()' method,
 * since it totally madness to understand and write such code. There is one CS hero,
 * who handled that task - Matt Might. He described a new approach of removing node
 * from red-black tree by using additional node colors (double black, negate black)
 * and new phase - 'bubbling'. Anyway, these things are a bit more then 'just-for-fun'
 * package. Here is the link to Matt's research:
 *
 *              http://matt.might.net/articles/red-black-delete/
 *
 * Chris Okasaki said in his blog that removing is awkward operation for functional
 * data structures due to persistence. What does 'remove' mean in a functional world?
 * It means that the client wants to get a new collection without one element. In functional
 * settings we can store both states of collection - without element 'x' (before insertion)
 * and with 'x' (after insertion). So, when the removing is needed for 'x' the previous
 * state of collection can be used instead.
 *
 * Anyway, red-black trees is a great data structure with fantastic running time
 * algorithms, but it's implementation is so complicated that you might use simple
 * BST instead. This is why, Robert Sedgewick invented left-leaning red-black trees as
 * simple (in terms of implementation) replacement for red-black trees. Here is his
 * awesome trees description:
 *
 *               http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/LLRB.pdf
 *
 * There are also two ways to improve current implementation. First of them - modify
 * 'balance()' method to expect violations only along the search path. Second - use
 * 'two-way-comparison' that is invented by Anre Andersonin method 'contains()'.
 * Here is the explanation of this idea:
 *
 *                  http://user.it.uu.se/~arnea/ps/searchproc.pdf
 *
 * This tree implementation doesn't inherit loads a useful methods from binary search
 * tree (see 'src/tree/Tree.scala') since is not necessary to have these methods in
 * both trees (it also brakes DRY principle). The main goal of this project - is to
 * provide a clear functional approaches of implementation functional data structures,
 * not to provide a completely stable collections and algorithms framework.
 *
 *
 * PS: I would be happy, if someone decided to add Matt's 'remove()' method into this
 *     implementation.
